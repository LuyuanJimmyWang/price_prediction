Group 17: Housing Price Prediction \
Description: \
We aimed to find the best regression model among linear regression, robust regression and lasso regression as the model that fits the housing price data best. \
We did data exploration, model fitting and performance evaluation in this ipynb file. \
This code required sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy and pandas, and it is basically the results that we discovered during the researching process. \
It can be run on colab and the outputs are mainly graphs and tables. It also includes some other types of figures as well.
